      <p>Student veterans usually react with a shoulder shrug, a brief, “Oh you know, for the money,” or an awkward “You’re welcome.”</p>
      <p>Instead of owning their military service, some choose not to identify as veterans or to downplay this significant aspect of their identities.</p>
      <p>But in a bright room on the second floor of the Humanities Building, student veterans freely discuss the soaring highs and devastating lows of serving in the military and the stigma they face outside the classroom. Nine men and one woman, seven ex-Marines and three ex-Army make up English Composition M138: "Writing Military Experience," a creative writing course taught by professor Reed Wilson, exclusively open to student veterans.</p>
      <p>Among the group are students who have known extreme poverty, drug abuse, alcoholism, eating disorders, mental illnesses and post-traumatic stress disorder. The banter in the room is acerbic, with cutting jokes and put-downs flying back and forth.</p>
      <p>“There’s one guy that’s not here that I openly beat on in each of my papers,” one student said jokingly, causing a ripple of knowing laughter from the others.</p>
      <p>But beneath the fooling around is a bedrock of respect, honesty and shared experiences. Almost all the veterans present have been deployed to fight in various conflicts, mostly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and many of them have struggled to adapt to civilian life after they “got out.”</p>
      <p>UCLA has more than 100 student veterans, and the community keeps a low profile. If they identify themselves as veterans, people’s perception of them is immediately warped.</p>
      <p>After leaving the military, many wanted to steer clear of other veterans and the memories associated with their time on deployment. But this class offers a different opportunity for each them: a chance to be open and express past experiences they have left unexplored or buried deep in their subconsciousness.</p>
      <p>Each week, the veterans take turns reading out their story, poem or other piece of creative writing.</p>
      <p>Some weeks the stories come easily, some weeks they don’t. Some weeks the memories flow through the keys and onto the screen, some weeks they don’t.</p>

      <p>"I Changed My Family Cycle" by Colt Gordon</p>
      <p>I come from an interesting background. Ironically it was somewhat of a war zone. My dad was a full-time violent alcoholic and a part time construction worker. My mom suffered from chronic PTSD from her pedophile of a stepfather who molested her and her sisters repeatedly. Getting smacked around was good for me in some ways as I learned to mind, but for my mom it was hell. She was thrown through a glass shower door by my dad once; and I can still hear her blood curdling screams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <p>Colt Gordon promised his grandma he would never get any tattoos. Given that his father was a tattoo artist and he was surrounded with body art during his time in the military, it was a serious promise to make.</p>
      <p>For a six-year period of his life, Gordon fought an eating disorder and suicidal ideations. One day while on deployment in Iraq, Gordon thought he was going to die by his own hands. That same day he promised a friend he would seek help.</p>
      <p>“I had a gun all the time, so I was always thinking how it would be easier if I was gone,” Gordon said. “But I had a friend who was always there for me, and he was the guy that said, ‘You never really opened up to me, but I care about you and I want you to promise me you’ll get help.’ I’m kinda juvenile in the sense that I always keep my promises.”</p>
      <p>He said he wouldn’t be here today if he hadn’t kept that promise. Gordon is a third-year psychology student who was recently elected as the next president of the UCLA Student Veterans of America.</p>
      <p>Writing about his experiences and reading his own writing aloud usually provides a dose of calm and catharsis for Gordon.</p>
      <p>But when it came to composing for English Composition M138, he found himself hesitating and worrying about what everyone else would think.</p>
      <p>“I’m naturally more of a guy that would have a cup of tea with the ladies, to be honest. It’s a weird thing about me,” Gordon said. “I can be very expressive and outward-going with women, but I didn’t have the inclination to hang out with the guys, shoot shit and talk about guns, but recently I’ve started embracing it and having more male friends.”</p>
      <p>In his piece “I Changed My Family Cycle,” which deals with the complex decision of why he joined the Marines, Gordon reveals he came from a background of mental, physical and alcoholic abuse. While his father “died by the bottle at 49,” and his brother is currently serving 10 years in prison for grand arson, Gordon has forged himself a different path.</p>
      <p>He joined the military to escape his situation, not serve his country out of some great sense of patriotism, he said.</p>
      <p>Without the military, Gordon wouldn’t have overcome his depression or become dedicated to helping others with mental illness. Without the military, Gordon probably wouldn’t be alive.</p>
      <p>“I’m almost 30, so some people could say that I’m late, I’m far behind, but there’s no way I would have gotten here without the military, there’s no way I would have turned my life around without the military,” Gordon said. “I have so many positive things to say about my time in the Marine Corps, even though it was hell.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote" data-aos="fade-right">
      <p>While the Marine Corps may have accelerated my pain it also increased my willingness to seek the inevitable help I needed. What took four years to bring me to my knees to get psychological help might have never happened out in the civilian world. When I got treatment I realized I was not weak. In fact, I was strong for what I had endured over my life. I simply needed tools to get better and to get my life back.</p>

      <p>"Strip Club Veteran" by Camilo Rocha</p>
      <p>Strip club veteran was this soldier’s name,</p>
      <p>Chugging cans of redbull as his personal cocaine,</p>
      <p>“Let’s go to Red Parrot!” he would exuberantly proclaim,</p>
      <p>Strip club veteran, he would put any man to shame.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="item">
      <p>Camilo Rocha doesn’t like to be underestimated.</p>
      <p>When a UCLA recruiter came to Pasadena City College where he was at school, Rocha approached her and asked about transferring to Westwood. She asked for his GPA; he replied it was 3.28. The recruiter smirked and told him he needn’t bother applying. I’ll show her, he thought.</p>
      <p>Rocha hunkered down, achieved straight A’s the next two semesters and transferred to UCLA as a psychology student.</p>
      <p>“When people say I can’t do something, it drives me, when people underestimate me, it drives me. That’s a big motivator in life, trying to prove people wrong,” Rocha said.</p>
      <p>Rocha’s parents both dropped out of middle school, and he describes the rest of his family as “drunks working in the fields.” In high school he was a self-confessed “alcoholic, pothead, hot-boxing teenager with a wild Afro and no prospects.”</p>
      <p>He worked at In-N-Out Burger for two years, waiting to get his high school diploma. While at work one day, Rocha observed an overweight, burger-flipping colleague with sweat dripping down his forehead. Rocha came to a terrifying realization: That could be him in 30 years.</p>
      <p>He had to do something drastic to escape the cycle of poverty his family was stuck in.</p>
      <p>“Joining the military was a means to an end,” Rocha said. “The alternative was being a pot dealer who smoked his own stash. ... Within a month of stepping into the recruitment office I was gone.”</p>
      <p>Seven years in the military brought many highs, lows and everything in between for Rocha, during which he met people from all walks and in all phases of life.</p>
      <p>One of professor Wilson’s prompts was to recount an interaction with another member of the armed forces, and Rocha wrote about a “strip club veteran” who parties every night and asks his friends to spot him a “couple 20s,” before slinking home to his wife at night.</p>
      <p>“I wanted the people to think this character’s a massive douchebag; he’s thrown away his cash on strippers instead of paying attention to his wife,” Rocha said.</p>
      <p>When he read his poem aloud in class, his fellow veterans laughed at the “strip club veteran’s” exploits and were eager to know who he was based on. To their amazement, Rocha revealed the “strip club veteran” was based on a 20-year-old version of himself.</p>
      <p>Writing the poem helped Rocha reflect on the person he used to be before he quit drinking and gave him perspective on how far he had come from his alcohol- and drug-fueled days.</p>
      <p>“To be the first to be here at UCLA, for myself and my son, it’s going to change the rest of our family lineage,” Rocha said. “You know, you can come from the shittiest background possible, be in the worst situation, but if you put in the effort, fight the odds, you can be a success too.”</p>

      <p>With a face full of glitter and reeking of booze,</p>
      <p>He sneaks back home while his wife takes a snooze,</p>
      <p>“Hun is that you? It’s late where you been?”</p>
      <p>“Just taking care of ARMY stuff” he says with a grin.</p>
